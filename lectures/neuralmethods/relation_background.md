# Injecting logical background into embeddings for relation extraction
Relation extraction is part of information extraction

Recent New approaches:
- unifying canonical relations in a universal schema
- completing that schema using matrix factorization

Approach from the paper = matrix factorization + first-order logic formulae

Essentially, this is the content of logical foundations for computational linguistics

Goal: extend the class of formulae from such facts ( sth(a, b) ) to formulae like forall ( a b : sth(a, b) -> sthelse(a,b) )


QUESTIONS
- what are canonical relations
- how can those schemas be completed using matrix factorization
- what is distant supervision?
- what are first-order logic formulae
- what are surface patterns / surface-form relations
