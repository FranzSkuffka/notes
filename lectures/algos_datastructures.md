# Algorithms & Data Structures
sorting algorithms is the classic

Books don't go into the same depth as the lecture.

## Grading algorithms
what is good?
performance
efficiency
correctness

a range of techniques that overlap with theoretical computer science

## Computer algorithms
- finite - can be implemented using finit resources with a finite number of instructions
- terminable - must complete in a limited amount of time. Break-rules might make sense
- deterministic - same input same output
- 
- 
Properties
- deterministic - only one way to solve the problem, only one next step at any given time.
- determinable - same I, same O
