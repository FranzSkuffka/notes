# Purpose of the course
develop an intuition on how syntax is formed

constituents are structural units in sentences
NP

stefan mÃ¼ller - grammatiktherie
- guter abschnitt zu konstituenten


pronom test and question test doesn't work for verbs

Questions
difference phrase strcuture rules and grammar rules
-> it's the same but extended by some concepts


# X-Bar Theory
X is anything
X- = X-Bar
```
XP -> (YP) X-
X- -> (ZP) X- // recursive rule

X- -> X- (ZP)
X- -> (QP*) X (QP*)
```
`*` is a quantifier
`(...)` is a quantifier


useful for English

```

`a big book of poems`

ZP = adjuncts

Apparently there is a conventional set of parse rules

When NP then N is the head

X-Bar theory is not sufficient

# To learn by heart
- word types
- rather than learning rules, we 
process what is the constituents
what is required
what can be extended


# Topological Field Theory
Linke und Rechte Satzklammer

Vorfeld | LK | Mittelfeld | RK | Nachfeld

# Dependency structure
finite verb rules sentence
determiner depend on noun
prepositions rule nouns
