augmentation = extend our capabilities

"Think of a rider on a horse: If a rider uses deliberate movements, the horse follows exactly. As the control becomes vaguer, the horse resorts to familiar behaviour patterns and takes over control. Being able to “loosen or tighten the reins” leads to smooth ebb and  ow of control between human and horse, rather than instructions and responses. Considering feedback and control is key."
