# Inspirational Leadership and Neuroscience
Balthazard, Waldman, Peterson

## Background
- effectivity of classical training is questionable
- theoretically linking neuroscientific measures to qualities of leaders is a challenge
- dominant left-brain = good planners, dominant right brain = managers or leaders
- coherence = how coordinated are different parts of the brain

question: what does coherence look like in a eeg?

question: does meditation influence right-part / front part / coherence / cortical region (see below)
question: how does meditation influence different brain waves? Are beta waves stressful?
question: does cardio / long distance running influence this?
question: what doe different brain waves mean


- emotional intelligence = promoting positive, keeping negative emotions in check
  - may have a basis in brain circutry - how cortical regions manage and interpret neurotransmitter signals
  - goleman, boyatzis ... 2001
  - does meditation have the capability to change this behaviour over time? Personal experience suggests that
- cortex may be used to asses risk
- front part is important for emotions
  - right front part important for interpersonal communication and associated traits
  - right frontal may play big role in Inspirational Leadership - because it's important for socialized visionary communication

## Method
- research of paper is focused on right-brain coherence, especially frontal
- visionary communication challenge and indirect assessment through rating of inspiration / charisma

- not used: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  - subjects are in unnatural, immobilzed setting
- used: quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG)
  - subjects can be engaged in everyday tasks
  - measures of the waves:
    - amplitude
    - frequency
  - five bandwidths: delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma
  - focus is *beta* - beta are most prevalent in the alert brain and associated with cognitive process
